1: General                                                         *Breakpoint*

This plugin allows you to place breakpoints in Vim. These can later be
sourced by GDB.

If there exists a file named `.breakpoints_<filename>` in the same directory
as <file> then Vim loads breakpoint data from that file. If any breakpoints
are set when Vim saves then those are saved to that file. If there are no
breakpoints in the file during a save then the breakpoints file is removed.

The breakpoints file is also formatted as a GDB breakpoints file, allowing GDB
to source it. As well as any GDB breakpoint file to be used for
vim-breakpoint.

Primary distribution and latest version of this plugin should be available at:
    https://github.com/HugoNikanor/vim-breakpoint

2: Vim Usage                                                    *BreakpointVim*

Bindings:

<leader>a                           toggles breakpoint on current line

----------------------------------------------------------------------
Functions:

The following functions are available from vim-breakpoint.

`breakpoint#place([line])          ` Places a breakpoint, ether at the
                                   current line, or at the line given
                                   by {line}.

`breakpoint#remove()`                Removes the breakpoint at current line

`breakpoint#toggle()`                Toggles the breakpoint at current line

`breakpoint#save()`                  Saves all breakpoints in current file
                                   to `.breakpoints_<file>` 

`breakpoint#load()`                  Loads all breakpoints from
                                   `.breakpoints_<file>` into Vim.



=============================================================================
3: GDB Usage                                                    *BreakpointGDB*

Vim-breakpoint saves its breakpoints to a file called `.breakpoints_<file>`.
GDB can then source that file, by running (in gdb):
>
    (gdb) source .breakpoints_<file>

=============================================================================
4: Configuration                                             *BreakpointConfig*

Plugin configuration is done in `~/.vim/ftplugin/breakpoint.vim`.
It's possible to change both color and shape.

Example: >
    highlight Breakpoint ctermfg=Yellow
    sign define breakpoint text=<> texthl=Breakpoint
<
Where the ctermfg=Yellow can be changed for a different color, and the text=<>
can be changed for a different symbol. See |:sign| for more information.
